This is quite a simple decision tree script done in the first ML project at Imperial. My main contributions were for the evaluation and visualisation methods. This of course is in the context of the actual code, all aspects of theory were worked in as a whole group.

The idea was that we were to used a decision tree in a classification problem. We had 7 wifi signals of different strengths, and from that we would be able to identify which of 4 rooms the readings would take.

I haven't attached the data for this but it can be provided.
