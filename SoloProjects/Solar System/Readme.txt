Find attached a simulation of the inner solar system (the sun to Mars). The idea was that the simulation would accurately predict the orbit of all the celestial objects (ignoring moons) in that area. In the simulation (run the solar.py to see it) the orbits are sped up, but if you look at periods.txt it has the predicted orbital periods which should be accurate (minus a little error as the real solar system orbits are far more complex).

The second objective of this project was to determine the optimal launch velocity (vertical and horizontal) of a satellite sent from earth to mars. This was mostly done by trial and error at the time (was my first proper project) and now would be redone using a threshold based iterative algorithm. The value of the proper optimal velocity was near identical to the value quoted by NASA.
