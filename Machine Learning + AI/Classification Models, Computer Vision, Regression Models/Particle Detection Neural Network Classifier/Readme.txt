The python code is in a jupyter notebook. I would really like to stress that this project did not have at all focus on proper OOL or coding style. The assignment was given more or less as just do something you think would be interesting and makes use of a neural network. I made a classifier for particles detected in a Geant4 C++ simulation based on the Atlas Detector at Cern. The C++ code can be found in src.

In terms of the evaluation of the algorithm I mostly just used accuracy. Of course other metrics such as confusion matrices would have been very useful, but again the spec for the project was not super fussed about such things.

I have still included it, as I did think it was quite a cool project, and it does also give examples of my ability in c++
